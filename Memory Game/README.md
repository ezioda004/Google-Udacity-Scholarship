## Instructions

Memory game is a simple memorizing game. There are 16 cards, click on any card to get started! As soon as you click the card a timer on the top right of the screen would start. It'll stop only when you finish the game or if you press the reset button.

The game also counts the number of moves you've made so far after clicking the first card and gives you stars based on number of moves you took to complete the game.

You can also store the scores after you win the game and see the previous local scores by clicking "Show Scores" button.
